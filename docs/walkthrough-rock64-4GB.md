## Installing Armbian Stretch 

`NOTE:` The steps provided below produce a “headless” server... meaning we will not be using a GUI to configure Hyperspace or check to see how things are running. In fact, once the server is set up, you will only interact with it using command line calls over `SSH`. The idea is to have this hosting node be simple, low-power, with optimized memory usage and something that “just runs” in your basement, closet, etc.
